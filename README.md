# ide-latex package

The all-in-one package I thought I'd never make.

All functionality can (read: will if I remember) be togglable though, so there's that.

Syntax highlighting needs to be provided by another package, preferably `language-latex` or `language-latex2e`.

## Features
- Folding
- Autocomplete
- Linting
- Wordcount
- Hyperclick
- General features as I think of them
