# ide-latex package

---------------
:warning: This package will not work for you yet. It needs the corresponding [language server](https://github.com/Aerijo/latex-language-server) to be installed, and that is still in development.

The all-in-one package I thought I'd never make.

All functionality can (read: will if I remember) be togglable though, so there's that.

Syntax highlighting needs to be provided by another package, preferably `language-latex` or `language-latex2e`.

## Features (planned)
- Folding
- Autocomplete
- Linting
- Wordcount (and frequency?)
- Hyperclick
- General features as I think of them
- Compile
- Tree of project
- Preview equations
- Various table creation / navigation tools
- Image drag and drop (? no idea how to do this one)
- Templates (basically large snippets & autocomplete --- pull from online?)
- Spell checking rules
- Search in project
- Suggest making project a git repository (with directory blacklist)
